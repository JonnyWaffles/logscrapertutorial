# Purpose
A coworker wanted to learn Python to perform some log monitoring. Monitoring logs
felt like a great beginners project, as one could accomplish it as basic or as complex
as desired. As such, I decided to put together a little tutorial repository to both help
teach beginners, and inform myself of some of the more complex aspects of Python.

I hope others could benefit from this tutorial.

## Lessons
Each lesson takes the task a little bit further and explains why and how the code is designed the way it is.

## Data
Fake data for the lessons will be generated in the data package.

## Status
Currently a work in progress!

## Instructions
Clone down the repository and install the requirements with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run the lessons and inspect the source!
